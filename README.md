Project Description

A silly yet highly ‚Äúscientific‚Äù web app that tells you exactly how long your favorite biscuit can survive in chai before it meets its soggy end ‚Äî with a dramatic countdown and biscuit-themed visuals.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People around the world live in constant fear of their biscuits collapsing into their tea. The heartbreak is real‚Ä¶ but no one asked for a solution.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We give you a biscuit survival prediction system with a clock-style countdown and funny messages so you can prepare emotionally for the inevitable soggy demise.
